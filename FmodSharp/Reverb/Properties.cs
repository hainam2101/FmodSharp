    [
        [DESCRIPTION]
        Structure defining a reverb environment.<br>
        <br>
        For more indepth descriptions of the reverb properties under win32, please see the EAX2 and EAX3
        documentation at http://developer.creative.com/ under the 'downloads' section.<br>
        If they do not have the EAX3 documentation, then most information can be attained from
        the EAX2 documentation, as EAX3 only adds some more parameters and functionality on top of 
        EAX2.

        [REMARKS]
        Note the default reverb properties are the same as the FMOD_PRESET_GENERIC preset.<br>
        Note that integer values that typically range from -10,000 to 1000 are represented in 
        decibels, and are of a logarithmic scale, not linear, wheras float values are always linear.<br>
        <br>
        The numerical values listed below are the maximum, minimum and default values for each variable respectively.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUPPORTED</b> next to each parameter means the platform the parameter can be set on.  Some platforms support all parameters and some don't.<br>
        EAX   means hardware reverb on FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_DSOUND on windows only (must use FMOD_HARDWARE), on soundcards that support EAX 1 to 4.<br>
        EAX4  means hardware reverb on FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_DSOUND on windows only (must use FMOD_HARDWARE), on soundcards that support EAX 4.<br>
        I3DL2 means hardware reverb on FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_DSOUND on windows only (must use FMOD_HARDWARE), on soundcards that support I3DL2 non EAX native reverb.<br>
        GC    means Nintendo Gamecube hardware reverb (must use FMOD_HARDWARE).<br>
        WII   means Nintendo Wii hardware reverb (must use FMOD_HARDWARE).<br>
        PS2   means Playstation 2 hardware reverb (must use FMOD_HARDWARE).<br>
        SFX   means FMOD SFX software reverb.  This works on any platform that uses FMOD_SOFTWARE for loading sounds.<br>
        <br>
        Members marked with [in] mean the user sets the value before passing it to the function.<br>
        Members marked with [out] mean FMOD sets the value to be used after the function exits.<br>
