        [DESCRIPTION]   


        [REMARKS]
        If you are using FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_RAW and speaker assignments are meaningless, just cast a raw integer value to this type.<br>
        For example (FMOD_SPEAKER)7 would use the 7th speaker (also the same as FMOD_SPEAKER_SIDE_RIGHT).<br>
        Values higher than this can be used if an output system has more than 8 speaker types / output channels.  15 is the current maximum.

        [PLATFORMS]
        Win32, Win64, Linux, Linux64, Macintosh, Xbox360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, Wii
